#### The Evolution of the NBA and the Rise of Three-Point Shooting

In the modern NBA, the emphasis on three-point shooting has dramatically reshaped the game, altering team strategies and player development. This evolution has elevated the importance of proficiency in three-point shooting to an essential skill for players across all positions. Being adept at long-range shooting is now a critical factor in a player's career, influencing their ability to secure a spot on a team and potentially impacting their market value. As a result, NBA teams are increasingly focusing on developing this skill in their players, leveraging targeted training and analytics to enhance shooting effectiveness. A player's capability to consistently make three-point shots can significantly boost their importance to a team, affecting decisions related to drafts, trades, and contracts. In this era, a player's success in three-point shooting can be a key determinant of their career trajectory, highlighting the significant role of long-range shooting in the contemporary NBA.

#### Challenges in Evaluating Three-Point Shooting Talent

As the NBA's emphasis on three-point shooting continues to grow, its impact on the draft and scouting processes has become increasingly significant. The ability of a prospect to shoot from long range is now a major factor in their overall evaluation, influencing how teams perceive their potential and future success in the league. However, accurately projecting a college player's three-point shooting ability to the NBA level is a challenging aspect of scouting. This difficulty arises because players' performances can vary widely once they transition from college basketball to the professional stage. Some players may significantly improve their shooting due to advanced training methods and a focus on skill development, while others may struggle to replicate their college success or fail to develop their shooting abilities further.

A key issue in this scouting dilemma is the relatively small sample size of three-point shooting attempts in college, which can lead to unstable and misleading percentages. College players often have shorter seasons and fewer games compared to the NBA, resulting in less data to analyze and a higher chance of variability in their shooting performance. This makes it hard for scouts and teams to confidently predict which players will continue to excel as three-point shooters, who will improve with time and training, and who might not transition their shooting skills effectively to the professional level. Despite the critical role of three-point shooting in determining a player's impact in the NBA, the unpredictability of shooting development post-college remains a significant challenge for teams looking to draft prospects with the potential to excel in today's game.

#### Predictive Modeling: A Solution to Three-Point Shooting Evaluation

Given the challenging and often unpredictable nature of assessing college prospects' three-point shooting capabilities for the NBA, this project aims to leverage predictive modeling and machine learning techniques to forecast a player's three-point shooting performance at the professional level. By utilizing a comprehensive dataset of college statistics from current NBA players, with their NBA three-point shooting percentages serving as the target variable, this approach seeks to identify patterns and predictors that may not be immediately apparent through traditional scouting methods.

The rationale behind employing predictive modeling lies in the inherent randomness and difficulty associated with evaluating three-point shooting potential. NBA front offices could greatly benefit from a methodology that offers a more accurate prediction of a prospect's ability to shoot from long range, based solely on statistical analysis. This would allow teams to allocate their scouting resources and attention more efficiently, focusing on assessing other aspects of a player's game that are less random and more observable through traditional evaluation methods, such as defensive skills and playmaking abilities.

## Data Cleaning
### Target Engineering

When assessing NBA three-point shooting skill, it's crucial to recognize that not all three-point shots are created equal. A simple three-point shooting percentage, while useful, doesn't fully capture a player's shooting ability. This metric can be misleading, as it doesn't account for the context in which shots are taken. Players who only attempt three-pointers when wide open may have inflated percentages compared to those who frequently shoot under more challenging conditions.

To address this discrepancy and create a more nuanced target variable for our predictive modeling, I have refined the traditional three-point shooting percentage. Our engineered target metric adjusts a player's three-point percentage by considering the volume of three-pointers attempted per 100 possessions. This adjustment acknowledges that players who shoot more often are likely taking harder shots, thus providing a better indicator of true shooting skill.

Additionally, we've introduced a slight adjustment factor based on the total number of three-point attempts a player has made over their career. This factor is rooted in the principle that a larger sample size of shot attempts offers a more stable and reliable measure of a player's three-point shooting talent. It accounts for the variability and noise in shooting percentages, especially in cases where players have fewer attempts. Essentially, our engineered target variable aims to balance percentage accuracy with shot difficulty and confidence in a player's shooting ability derived from their attempt volume.

This methodological refinement ensures that our predictive model considers not just how accurately players shoot from beyond the arc, but also the context of their shooting—leading to a more accurate assessment of three-point shooting skill in the NBA.

By redirecting the focus away from the highly variable task of projecting three-point shooting potential—which has proven to be a complex and sometimes misleading aspect of player evaluation—teams can instead prioritize the scouting of skills and attributes that lend themselves to more consistent and qualitative analysis. This strategic shift in talent evaluation emphasizes the development and recognition of well-rounded players, while still acknowledging the critical role that three-point shooting plays in the modern NBA. Through this project, we aim to provide NBA front offices with a tool that enhances their ability to predict three-point shooting success, optimizing the draft and development process by using data-driven insights to complement traditional scouting expertise.
